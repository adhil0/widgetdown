# widgetdown

The goal of widgetdown is to test htmlwidgets within a pkgdown website, without
bloating the main [pkgdown](https://github.com/r-lib/pkgdown) distribution.

## Installation

Install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("jayhesselberth/widgetdown")
```
